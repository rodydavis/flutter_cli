### Generating Flutter project

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to visit the project you just built.
Command following will assume that you are in the root directory of
the project.

This command will generate component under folder `lib/`.
You can use option `-p` to change the folder.


### Generating test

and the other one is test file.
